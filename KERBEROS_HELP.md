In order to use Integrated Authentication (aka Windows Authentication) on macOS or Linux you will need to setup a Kerberos ticket linking your current user to a Windows domain account. A summary of key steps are included below.

# Setup Kerberos on Mac

## Requirements

-   Access to a Windows domain-joined machine in order to query your Kerberos Domain Controller
-   SQL Server should be configured to allow Kerberos authentication. For the client driver running on Unix, integrated authentication is only supported using Kerberos. More information on setting up Sql Server to authenticate using Kerberos can be found [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/319723/how-to-use-kerberos-authentication-in-sql-server). There should be SPNs registered for each instance of Sql Server you are trying to connect to. Details about the format of SQL Server SPNs are listed [here](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms191153%28v=sql.105%29.aspx#SPN%20Formats)

### Checking if Sql Server has Kerberos Setup

-   Login to the host machine of Sql Server. From Windows Command Prompt use the `setspn -L %COMPUTERNAME%` to list all the Service Principal Names for the host. You should see entries which begin with MSSQLSvc/HostName.Domain.com which means that Sql Server has registered an SPN and is ready to accept Kerberos authentication.
-   If you don't have access to the Host of the Sql Server, then from any other Windows OS joined to the same Active Directory, you could use the command `setspn -L <SQLSERVER_NETBIOS>` where <SQLSERVER_NETBIOS> is the computer name of the Sql server host.

## Steps to set up Integrated Authentication

### Step 1: Find Kerberos KDC (Key Distribution Center)

-   **Run on**: Windows, Windows command line
-   **Action**: `nltest /dsgetdc:DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM` (where “DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM” maps to your domain’s name)
-   **Sample Output**
    ```
    DC: \\dc-33.domain.company.com
    Address: \\2111:4444:2111:33:1111:ecff:ffff:3333
    ...
    The command completed successfully
    ```
-   **Information to extract**
    The DC name, in this case `dc-33.domain.company.com`

### Step 2: Configuring KDC in krb5.conf

-   **Run on**: MAC
-   **Action**: Edit the /etc/krb5.conf in an editor of your choice. Configure the following keys

    ```
    [libdefaults]
      default_realm = DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM
     
    [realms]
    DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM = {
       kdc = dc-33.domain.company.com
    }
    ```

    Then save the krb5.conf file and exit

    **Note** Domain must be in ALL CAPS

### Step 3: Testing the Ticket Granting Ticket retrieval

-   **Run on**: Mac
-   **Action**:
    -   Use the command `kinit username@DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM` to get a TGT from KDC. You will be prompted for your domain password.
    -   Use `klist` to see the available tickets. If the kinit was successful, you should see a ticket from krbtgt/DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM@ DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM.

### Step 4: Connect in VSCode

-   Create a new connection profile
-   Choose `Integrated` as the authentication type
-   If all goes well and the steps above worked, you should be able to connect successfully!

# Setup Kerberos on Linux

### Step 0: Install krb5-user package

-   **Run on**: Linux
-   **Action**: `apt-get install krb5-user`

### Step 1: Find Kerberos KDC (Key Distribution Center)

-   **Run on**: Windows command line
-   **Action**: `nltest /dsgetdc:DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM` (where “DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM” maps to your domain’s name)
-   **Sample Output**
    ```
    DC: \\dc-33.domain.company.com
    Address: \\2111:4444:2111:33:1111:ecff:ffff:3333
    ...
    The command completed successfully
    ```
-   **Information to extract**
    The DC name, in this case `dc-33.domain.company.com`

### Step 2: Configuring KDC in krb5.conf

-   **Run on**: Linux
-   **Action**: Edit the /etc/krb5.conf in an editor of your choice. Configure the following keys

    ```
    [libdefaults]
      default_realm = DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM
     
    [realms]
    DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM = {
       kdc = dc-33.domain.company.com
    }
    ```

    Then save the krb5.conf file and exit

    **Note** Domain must be in ALL CAPS

### Step 3: Testing the Ticket Granting Ticket retrieval

-   **Run on**: Linux
-   **Action**:
    -   Use the command `kinit username@DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM` to get a TGT from KDC. You will be prompted for your domain password.
    -   Use `klist` to see the available tickets. If the kinit was successful, you should see a ticket from krbtgt/DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM@ DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM.

### Step 4: Connect in VSCode

-   Create a new connection profile
-   Choose `Integrated` as the authentication type
-   If all goes well and the steps above worked, you should be able to connect successfully!
