# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[aasim/feat/###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Node.js 20+)  \
**Primary Dependencies**: VS Code Extension API, React (webviews), Yarn classic workspace  \
**Storage**: N/A (extension; uses external SQL Tools Service + remote databases)  \
**Testing**: Mocha unit tests, Playwright smoke tests (where applicable)  \
**Target Platform**: VS Code Desktop (extension) and Webviews
**Project Type**: Monorepo (multiple VS Code extensions under `extensions/`)  \
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Security & privacy: confirm no secrets/PII exposure; telemetry/logging considerations documented.
- UX/localization: confirm user-facing strings are localizable; entry points are discoverable.
- Tests/verification: confirm test plan exists (tests or justification + alternative verification).
- Compatibility: confirm breaking changes are identified with migration notes.
- Diagnose-ability/perf: confirm errors are actionable; perf impact considered for hot paths.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
