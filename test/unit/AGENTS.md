## Instructions for writing good unit tests:

### Rules & Expectations

-   Do not edit application/source files unless the refactor demands it. Confirm before editing files outside of /test/unit, and justify why you need to make those changes.
-   Use Sinon, not TypeMoq. If easily possible, replace TypeMoq mocks/stubs/helpers with Sinon equivalents.
-   Use a Sinon sandbox (setup/teardown with sinon.createSandbox()); keep helper closures (e.g., createServer) inside setup where the
    sandbox is created. Similarly, let the teardown handle all the stub restores wherever possible; avoid manual restore() calls in tests unless the test design needs the stub behavior changed.
-   Default to chai.expect; when checking Sinon interactions, use sinon-chai.
-   Avoid Object.defineProperty hacks and (if possible) fake/partial plain objects; use sandbox.createStubInstance(type) and sandbox.stub(obj, 'prop').value(...).
-   Add shared Sinon helpers to test/unit/utils.ts when theyâ€™ll be reused.
-   If updating preexisting tests, preserve relevant inline comments from the original tests.
-   When introducing a Sinon helper to replace a TypeMoq helper (e.g., capabilities mock), follow the utils.ts pattern: accept an optional
    sandbox, create stub instances, and return them.
-   Avoid unnecessary casts, like `myVar as unknown as MyType` when myVar is already a sinon-stubbed instance of MyType.
-   Maintain existing formatting conventions, line endings, and text encoding.
-   Nest test suits as necessary to group tests in a logical manner.

### Process

-   Write tests following the rules and expectations defined above.
-   Validate the tests written by running the test suite you've edited.
-   Don't commit your changes unless directly instructed. If you do create git commits, follow these rules:
    -   Choose a concise commit message
    -   Orgnize the contents of each commit with test files that make sense together. It's okay for each .test.ts file to have its own commit if they're not related.

### Testing

Use the provided command format: yarn test -- --grep <test suite name>.
