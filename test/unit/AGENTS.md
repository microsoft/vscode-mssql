## Instructions for writing good unit tests:

### Rules & Expectations

-   Do not edit application/source files unless writing effective unit tests demands it. Confirm before editing files outside of /test/unit, and justify why you need to make those changes.
-   Use Sinon, not TypeMoq. If easily possible, replace TypeMoq mocks/stubs/helpers with Sinon equivalents.
-   Use a Sinon sandbox (setup/teardown with sinon.createSandbox()); keep helper closures (e.g., createServer) inside setup where the
    sandbox is created.
-   Use chai's `expect` for assertions; when checking Sinon interactions, use sinon-chai. Avoid `sinon.assert` and Node's `assert` in favor of `expect(...).to.have.been...` helpers.
-   Avoid Object.defineProperty hacks and (if possible) fake/partial plain objects; use sandbox.createStubInstance(type) and sandbox.stub(obj, 'prop').value(...).
-   Add shared Sinon helpers to test/unit/utils.ts when theyâ€™ll be reused.
-   If updating preexisting tests, preserve relevant inline comments from the original tests.
-   When introducing a Sinon helper to replace a TypeMoq helper (e.g., capabilities mock), follow the utils.ts pattern: accept an optional
    sandbox, create stub instances, and return them.
-   Avoid unnecessary casts, like `myVar as unknown as MyType` when myVar is already a sinon-stubbed instance of MyType.
-   Maintain existing formatting conventions, line endings, and text encoding.
-   Nest test suites as necessary to group tests in a logical manner.
-   Always await async prompt helpers (for example, `await prompt.render()`) so sinon stubs execute before assertions.
-   If the class under test relies on VS Code services (event emitters, secret storage, etc.), stub their accessors via the sandbox (e.g., `sandbox.stub(obj, 'prop').get(() => emitter)` or provide a real `new vscode.EventEmitter()`) rather than providing a plain object.

### Process

-   Write tests following the rules and expectations defined above.
-   Validate the tests written by running the test suite you've edited.
-   Don't commit your changes unless directly instructed. If you do create git commits, follow these rules:
    -   Choose a concise commit message
    -   Orgnize the contents of each commit with test files that make sense together. It's okay for each .test.ts file to have its own commit if they're not related.

### Testing

Use the provided command format: yarn test -- --grep <test suite name>.
