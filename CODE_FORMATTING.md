## Code Formatting

### Steps to Update Rules

1. Update config files
2. Mass-apply config changes using the CLI method (see table below for usage)
3. Commit changes and send for PR
4. After that PR is merged, add its commit hash to `.git-blame-ignore-revs` so that `git blame` ignores mass-formatting commits and instead focuses on "real" changes

### Config Locations

Code formatting is done via Prettier, but that can be triggered in several different ways and each has its own config location.

> ðŸ‘‰ Update _all_ locations when changing formatting rules.

|File|Function|How to Use|
|-|-|-|
| `prettier.config.mjs` | used by the command-line `prettier` command for bulk formatting|`npm install -g prettier`<br /> `prettier "**/*.ts" [--write \| --check]` |
| `.vscode/settings.json` | used by VS Code's Prettier extension | Install Prettier extension (`esbenp.prettier-vscode`), then run the "Format Document" command |
| `eslint.config.mjs` | used by Git's precommit ESLint checks | Automatically run when creating a commit |
