/**
 * Cloud Deploy — diagnostic event bus.
 *
 * In-process, typed publish/subscribe over the closed `DiagnosticEvent`
 * catalog (`./types`). One instance per `CloudDeployService`; subscribers
 * reach it as `cloudDeployService.diagnostics`.
 *
 * Design properties:
 *   - **Generic over the catalog.** Every method signature references the
 *     `DiagnosticEvent` union as a whole — never a specific arm. New events
 *     are added by extending the union; this file does not change.
 *   - **Two subscription shapes.** `onDidEmit` is the firehose (telemetry,
 *     log forwarder, tests); `on(type, handler)` is selective and narrows
 *     the handler argument to the matching arm.
 *   - **Bus stamps the envelope.** Callers provide `source`, `type`, and
 *     `payload`. The bus generates a fresh `id`, stamps `timestampMs`, and
 *     defaults `severity` to `"info"`.
 *   - **Synchronous delivery.** Subscribers run inline on `emit()`. A
 *     subscriber that needs to do async work queues internally.
 *   - **Per-subscriber error isolation.** Inherited from `vscode.EventEmitter`:
 *     a thrown subscriber is logged by VS Code and does not stop delivery to
 *     the rest.
