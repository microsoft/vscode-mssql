### Contributions and "thank you"
We would like to thank everyone who contributed to localization for this update and encourage more people to join our [open source community localization effort](https://github.com/Microsoft/Localization/wiki).
mssql for Visual Studio Code was opened for community localization since February 2017 for the following languages French, Italian, German, Spanish, Simplified or Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese.
If you see a string untranslated in your language, you can make an impact and help with translation. You can find out how by checking https://aka.ms/crossplattoolsforsqlservercommunitylocalization.


## What's new in 1.1
* Preview support for Integrated Authentication (aka Windows Authentication) on Mac and Linux. To use this you need to create a Kerberos ticket on your Mac or Linux machine - [see this guide](https://aka.ms/vscode-mssql-integratedauth) for the simple process. Once this is set up, you can say goodbye to SQL passwords when connecting to your servers!
  * This feature is in preview in .Net Core 2.0. The [corefx repository](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx) tracks issues related to SqlClient and we recommend issues setting up Kerberos tickets be raised there.
  * macOS "El Capitan" and older versions will not support this feature or any other features requiring a new SqlToolsService version. To benefit from Integrated Authentication, "Execute Current Statement" and other new features we recommend updating to the latest OS version.
* New code snippets:
  * `sqlGetSpaceUsed` shows space used by tables. Thanks to Rodolfo Gaspar for this contribution!
  * `sqlListColumns` shows columns for tables matching a `LIKE` query. Thanks to Emad Alashi for this contribution!
* Support for connecting using a connection string. When adding a connection profile you can now paste in an ADO.Net connection string instead of specifying server name, database name etc. individually. This makes it easy to get strings from the Azure Portal and use them in the tool.
* Support for empty passwords when connecting. Password is no longer required, though still recommended! This is useful in local development scenarios.
* Improved support for SQL Server 2017 syntax by refreshing IntelliSense and SMO dependencies.
* Fixed all code snippets so that tab ordering is improved and snippets no longer have syntax errors
* Fixed issue where snippets were not shown when `mssql.intelliSense.enableIntelliSense` was set to `false`.
* Fixed issue [#911](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mssql/issues/911) where tools service crashed when Perforce source code provider is enabled in the workspace.
* Stability fixes to reduce the likelihood of SqlToolsService crashes.
* Fixed issue [#870](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mssql/issues/870). Added an "Execute Current Statement" command that executes only the SQL statement where the cursor is currently located.
* Fix issue [#939](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mssql/issues/939) "Show execution time for individual batches". To enable open your settings and set `mssql.showBatchTime` to `true`.
* Fix issue [#904](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mssql/issues/904). Added a "Disconnect" option to the status bar server connection shortcut. Clicking on this now lists databases on the current server and a "Disconnect" option.
* Fix issue [#913](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mssql/issues/913). OpenSuse Linux distributions are now supported.
