# MSSQL extension for Visual Studio Code

The [**MSSQL Extension for Visual Studio Code**](aka.ms/vscode-mssql) is designed to empower developers by providing a seamless and modern database development experience. Our goal is to make SQL development more productive and intuitive by integrating essential features such as schema management, query execution, and AI-powered assistance.

## General Availability Features

  - Use Microsoft Entra ID authentication for secure access
  - Manage multiple connection profiles for different environments
  - Reconnect to frequently used databases in just a few clicks
- **Execute queries and View Results**: Run your scripts and view results in a simple, yet powerful, grid with improved data visualization features:
  - View results in a unified interface alongside the integrated terminal and output panels or in their own tab.
  - Sort results by clicking on column headers.
  - Easily copy results with or without headers for use in other applications.
  - Export results to multiple formats, including JSON, Excel, and CSV.
  - Enhanced experience with live execution timing summary metrics and stability improvements on large result sets
  - View estimated plan and actual plan for T-SQL queries.
- **Enhanced T-SQL Editing Experience**: Write T-SQL scripts with a range of powerful features, including:
  - IntelliSense for faster and more accurate coding.
  - Go to Definition for exploring database objects.
  - T-SQL snippets to speed up repetitive tasks.
  - Syntax colorizations and T-SQL error validations.
  - Support for the `GO` batch separator.

  - Expand or collapse objects to explore hierarchy visually
  - Use enhanced filters to quickly locate items by name, owner, or creation date
  - Streamline development in large databases with fast object access
- **Table Designer**: A visual tool for creating and managing tables in your databases. Design every aspect of the table's structure, including:
  - Adding columns, setting data types, and specifying default values.
  - Defining primary keys and managing indexes to improve query performance.
  - Setting up foreign keys to maintain data integrity across tables.
  - Configuring advanced options like check constraints.
  - Automatically generate T-SQL scripts for your table design and apply changes directly to the database.
- **Query Plan Visualizer**: Analyze SQL query performance with detailed execution plans. Key features include:
  - Interact with each step in the execution plan, including collapsing or expanding nodes for a simplified view.
  - Zoom in or out to adjust the level of detail, or use "zoom to fit" for a complete view of the plan.
  - Highlight key performance indicators, such as elapsed time or subtree cost, to identify bottlenecks in query execution.
- **Customizable Extension Options**: Configure command shortcuts, appearance, and other settings to personalize your development experience.

## Public Preview Features

## Using the MSSQL Extension

Follow these steps to get started with the MSSQL extension:

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) and then install the **MSSQL extension** from the Extensions view or via the command palette (`F1`, then type `Install Extensions`).
2. macOS users: Install OpenSSL. See the [DotNet Core instructions](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) for prerequisites.
3. Open or create a `.sql` file. To manually set language mode, press `Ctrl+K M` and select **SQL**.
4. Press `F1`, type `MS SQL: Manage Connection Profile`, and follow the prompts to create a profile. See [manage connection profiles](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mssql/wiki/manage-connection-profiles) for advanced options.
5. Connect to a database using `F1` > `MS SQL: Connect` or the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+C`.
6. Write your T-SQL script using IntelliSense and snippets. Type `sql` to explore available snippets.
7. Run queries by selecting **MS SQL: Execute Query** from the Command Palette (`F1`), or use the shortcut:
  - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+E`
  - **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+E`
   View results in the result pane.
8. Customize shortcuts via the command palette or in your `settings.json`. See [customize shortcuts](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mssql/wiki/customize-shortcuts) for help.

## Command Palette Commands
The extension provides several commands in the Command Palette for working with ```.sql``` files. Here are some of the most commonly used commands:
* **MS SQL: Connect** to SQL Server, Azure SQL Database or SQL Data Warehouse using connection profiles or recent connections.
    * **Create Connection Profile** to create a new connection profile and connect.
* **MS SQL: Disconnect** from SQL Server, Azure SQL Database or SQL Data Warehouse in the editor session.
* **MS SQL: Use Database** to switch the database connection to another database within the same connected server in the editor session.
* **MS SQL: Execute Query** script, T-SQL statements or batches in the editor.
* **MS SQL: Cancel Query** execution in progress in the editor session.
